Sure, here is an example of a README.md file that explains how to run and set up the project:

Bank API
This project provides a Flask API for a bank that allows users to register for an account, login, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their account balance. The bank balances are stored in a Kubernetes Secret and accessed by the API using the kubernetes Python package.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
Setup
Clone the repository:
```json
git clone https://github.com/user/bank-api.git
cd bank-api
```json
Install the Python dependencies:

```json
pip install -r requirements.txt
```json
Run the init.bash script to create the AKS cluster and install the kubernetes Python package:
```json
./init.bash
```json
Create the Kubernetes Secret with the bank balances:
```json
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: bank-balances
type: Opaque
data:
  john-doe: NDk3
  jane-doe: NjUx
EOF
```json
Deploy the Flask API to the AKS cluster:

```json
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```json

Usage
To use the Flask API, you can send HTTP requests to the API endpoints using a tool such as curl or Postman.

Register for an account
To register for a bank account, send a POST request to the /register endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "password": "password",
  "initial_balance": 1000
}
```json
This request returns a JSON response with the details of the newly created bank account, including the id and balance:

```json
{
  "id": "123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "balance": 1000
}
```json
Login
To login to a bank account, send a POST request to the /login endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "password": "password"
}
```json
This request authenticates the user with the specified phone_number and password. If the authentication is successful, the request returns a JSON response with the details of the bank account, including the id and balance:

```json
{
  "id": "123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "balance": 1000
}
```json
Deposit money
To deposit money into a bank account, send a POST request to the /deposit endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "password": "password",
  "amount": 1000
}
```json
This request deposits the specified amount into the bank account with the given phone_number and password. If the deposit is successful, the request returns a JSON response with the updated details of the bank account, including the id and balance:

```json
{
  "id": "123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "balance": 2000
}
```json
Withdraw money
To withdraw money from a bank account, send a POST request to the /withdraw endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "password": "password",
  "amount": 500
}
```json
This request withdraws the specified amount from the bank account with the given phone_number and password. If the withdrawal is successful, the request returns a JSON response with the updated details of the bank account, including the id and balance:

```json
{
  "id": "123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "balance": 1500
}
```json
Check account balance
To check the balance of a bank account, send a GET request to the /balance endpoint with the following query parameters:

```json
phone_number=123456&password=password
```json
This request retrieves the balance of the bank account with the given phone_number and password. If the bank account exists, the request returns a JSON response with the details of the bank account, including the id and balance:

```json
{
  "id": "123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "123456",
  "balance": 1500
}
```json
